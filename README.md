# About projects
Here will be projects, that might interest some HR or employer, so they could see what I can do (or what I can not)

It is also possible to see explanation of this projects on [the site](https://lordserg.github.io/).

## List of wheels (random order):
- **RPN** - [Reverse Polish Notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation) a method that converts infix formula notation to postfix notation
- **Searching Of The Minimum Of Function** - study project that shows animation of minimum search algorithms (specifically  [Dichotomy method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bisection_method), [Golden-section method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden-section_search) and [Fibonacci method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_search_technique)
- **Numerical Methods Of Unconditional Optimization** - there are my realisations of classic methods of solving a problem of [unconditional optimisation](https://pns.hneu.edu.ua/pluginfile.php/293315/mod_resource/content/1/%D0%A2%D0%B5%D0%BC%D0%B0%2013.pdf)
- **Numerical Methods Of Conditional Optimization**  - another study project, where I implemented a method of [conditional optimisation](https://uk.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%97%D0%B0%D0%B4%D0%B0%D1%87%D0%B0_%D1%83%D0%BC%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%BD%D0%BE%D1%97_%D0%BE%D0%BF%D1%82%D0%B8%D0%BC%D1%96%D0%B7%D0%B0%D1%86%D1%96%D1%97)
- **Bitmap Image Filtering** - pretty big project that can read/print/write bitmap images. It also has an implementation of image filtering methods such as [Sobel operator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sobel_operator), [Prewitt operator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prewitt_operator) and generalised (3x3) matrix operator.
- **Ford-Fulkerson Algorithm** - project where I implemented guess [what](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford%E2%80%93Fulkerson_algorithm) :) In general it is a method for finding maximum throughput of the system.
- **Floating Horison Method** - study project that has an implementation of same called method. It is used for showing 3D objects.
- **Finding Path Simulation** - is a project that implements a path finding simulation for an agent on any graph using [Dijkstra's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm) .
- **Finding way** - is a first approach to the pathfinding problem between to points on a square plane
- **Celluar Automats** - implementation and generalisation of [Conway's game of life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life)
- **You Can't But Watch** - is a program that I've made for visually good animaions
- **Tangent Of The Curve** - is an experimental project, where I implemented a [Newton's approach to the tanget of the function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangent#Analytical_approach) in any given point
- **Circle Line Intersection** - visualisation of finding intersection between circle and line.
- **Lightning** - visualisation of a lightning strike using [L-system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-system) technique
- **Fourier Pendulum** - decompose a mouse-drawn image into two Fourier series and draws it.
- **Sort Visualisation** - program that visualizes classic sorting algorithms.
- **RSA** - implementation of [RSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem)) encoding and decoding algorithm
- **AES** - implementation of [AES](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard) encoding and decoding algorithm
- **Classic Ciphering** - implementation of [Caesar cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher) and [Transposition cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transposition_cipher) encoding and decoding algorithms
- **Perceptron** - realisation [backpropagation algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backpropagation) for simple neural network.
- **NNPointsOnPlane** - comparison of different perceptron architectures in action.
- **NNFigureRecognition** - program that can guess one of three basic shapes the user entered: circle, triangle and rectangle.

## List of games
- **Flatlander** - is a game where you take the role of a 2-dimensional creature that trapped in 3rd dimension. You can see the world through creature's eyes and help it exit to the top of the labirint.
- **QwEsTiOn** - game where you have to win using mouse only :)
