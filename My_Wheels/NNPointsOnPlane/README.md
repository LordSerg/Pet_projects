# Overview
A program for comparing different perceptron architectures for the same task.

# About project
In this project I wrote more structured OOP for NN and its learning.

Their task is to guess the color depending on coordinate.

Input: coordinate numbers **x** and **y**

Output: black or white color

There are 10 different NNs that adapt simultaneously. Each of them has sequence of numbers underneath - those are number of neurons in each layer, including input layer and output layer.

Every NN uses [backpropagation algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backpropagation) for learning.

User can input black and white dots for NNs to learn.
