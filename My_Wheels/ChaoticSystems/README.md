# Technology used
C++, OpenGL, GLFW, math

# Overview
Program that shows chaotic attractor of different differential systems, including classic ones as [Chen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiscroll_attractor), [Thomas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas%27_cyclically_symmetric_attractor), Lorenz and other attractors.

# About project
The idea is to put some particles to the space and apply to each of them some differential equation.

In a while those particles will form a beautiful pattern that called attractor.

## Examples
Example of Thomas attractor:
