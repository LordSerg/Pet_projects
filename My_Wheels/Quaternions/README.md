# Technology used
C++, OpenGL, GLFW, math, algorithms

# Overview
Program that shows 4D fractal based on [quaternion numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaternion).

# About project
I already have a [Julia fractal](https://github.com/LordSerg/Julias-Fractal) simulator.

Ideologically this is a very similar thing, but instead of complex numbers here were used quaternion numbers.
