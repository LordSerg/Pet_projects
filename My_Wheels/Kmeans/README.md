# Technology used
C#, WindowsForms, math, algorithms

# Overview
Program that implements [K-Means](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering) algorithm

# About project
This is one of the classic clustering algorithms, usually tested on Fisher's irises

But I was bored so I've added few things like
1. generating data
2. loading existing data
3. multy dimentional view of the data like I did [here](https://github.com/LordSerg/Dimensions)
4. step by step algorithm representation

## Examples
